== Description ==

Sidebar widget plugin that displays a list of posts (and much more) for a particular tag.
You can also add multiple instances of this widget. 
This plugin gives you full control on the widget with these options:

* custom widget Title (or no Title)
* custom text for the description of the content or whatever
* the Featured Tag dropdown menu (obviously required to show posts content), shows Tag: "Name-ID-(total posts)"
* how many posts for the featured Tag to show for each instance of the widget
* the posts informations to show: 
- image thumbnail (if present in the post)
- post title
- post author 

Have fun!

* Suitable for featured tags, Magazine covers and articles lists, links, business directory, etc.
* With two istances you can for example put just one image on one istance of the widget and a full list of posts on another instance, in order to have a perfect summary of specific issues.
* You can also use this widget as a Sidebar Gallery, showing just the images
* Insert a custom text box and, why not, an image or more for a particular tag.
* Let me know... Thank you.
